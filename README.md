# Known Bugs

# Things To Change or Implement In The Future

* Website was coded using HTML5 and Custom CSS3. I tried to add Bootstrap 4.4.1 whilst quite far into the project, this confused and overwrote a lot of CSS and ruind the site. With hindsite, this should have been implemented from the start, allowing my to make the site more responsive to a greater range of mobile devices and also allow me to add some more custom/fluid CSS content.
