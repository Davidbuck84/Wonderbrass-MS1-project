# Known Bugs

The embeded youtube video on index.html is not very responsive, after multiple tests and discussions with colleagues, I have reached the conclusion that the low quality of the original video, prevents the expected result.

# Things to Change or Implement in the Future

* The website was coded using HTML5 and Custom CSS3. 

* Whilst adding Bootstrap 4.4.1 at a later stage in the project, this subsquently overwrote the custom CSS and affected the layout/responsiveness of the site. With hindsite, Bootstrap should have been implemented from the start of the project, allowing me to make the site more responsive on a greater range of devices. It would also allow me to add more custom/fluid CSS content.

                    ----------- edit ------------

* All future projects, Bootstrap and other libraries will be added at the start of the project.
